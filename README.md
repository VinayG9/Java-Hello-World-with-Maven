## :book: Overview

This project is a simple Java Hello World application built using Maven as part of an assignment. The aim was to learn the basics of Java development, version control using Git, and continuous integration with Jenkins.


### :dart: Instructions

1. **Task 1**: Download or create a Maven-based Java Hello World application.
   - A simple Java application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. **Task 2**: Create an account on GitHub and create a repository.
   - A GitHub repository named `hello-world-java` was created to host this project.

3. **Task 3**: Download a Git client on your local computer or laptop.
   - Git was installed to manage version control for the project.

4. **Task 4**: Configure the Git client and push the Task 1 project to the GitHub repository.
   - The local Maven project was initialized as a Git repository and pushed to the GitHub repository.
